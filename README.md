# Freenove Three-wheeled Smart Car Kit for Raspberry Pi

## Setup

In this section you may find detailed instructions about the setup of the project. 

### SSL
In order to secure the connection between the car and the client you'll need to generate SSL certificates. An example using [CloudFlare's PKI toolkit](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cfssl/) is provided below.
#### Certificate Authority
This command creates a self-signed certificate for a certificate authority which is used to sign and validate client and server certificates.
```
cfssl gencert --initca ssl/ca-csr.json | cfssljson --bare ssl/ca
```
Both the server and the client require this certificate to validate each other. The following commands copy the certificate to the appropriate locations.
```
cp ssl/ca.pem api/ssl/ca.pem
cp ssl/ca.pem client/ssl/ca.pem
```

#### API certificate
This command creates a certificate for the API and signs it with the previously generated certificate authority. You might need to change the default hostname from "raspberrypi".
```
cfssl gencert --ca=ssl/ca.pem --ca-key=ssl/ca-key.pem --config=ssl/ca-config.json --hostname=raspberrypi ssl/api-csr.json | cfssljson --bare api/ssl/api
```

#### Client certificate
This command creates a certificate for the client and signs it with the previously generated certificate authority.
```
cfssl gencert --ca=ssl/ca.pem --ca-key=ssl/ca-key.pem --config=ssl/ca-config.json ssl/client-csr.json | cfssljson --bare client/ssl/client
```

### mjpg-streamer

The mjpg-streamer runs on the Raspberry PI and it is used to live stream what the car sees.

```
sudo apt install cmake libjpeg8-dev

git clone https://github.com/rolandsz/mjpg-streamer.git
cd mjpg-streamer/mjpg-streamer-experimental/
make -j4
sudo make install
```

### API
The gRPC API runs on the Raspberry PI and it is used to control the car remotely. You'll need to copy the *api* and *protos* folders to the Raspberry PI and execute the following commands in order.

```
sudo apt install python3-grpcio python3-grpc-tools

cd ~/Freenove_Three-wheeled_Smart_Car_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi/api
python3 -m grpc_tools.protoc -I../protos --python_out=./generated --grpc_python_out=./generated ../protos/buzzer_control.proto ../protos/camera_control.proto ../protos/car_control.proto ../protos/led_control.proto ../protos/ultrasonic_control.proto 
```

You will also need to enable I2C by exeuting the following command and selecting Interfacing Options > I2C.

```
sudo raspi-config
```

### Client
The client is a PyQt5 application that connects to the API running on the Raspberry PI via gRPC, which means you may run the client on an arbitrary device of your choice. Youâ€™ll need to setup the environment and generate the interface definitions by executing the following commands in order.

```
cd ~/Freenove_Three-wheeled_Smart_Car_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi/client
conda create --name smart-car-client python=3
conda activate smart-car-client
pip install -r requirements.txt

python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I../protos --python_out=./generated --grpc_python_out=./generated ../protos/buzzer_control.proto ../protos/camera_control.proto ../protos/car_control.proto ../protos/led_control.proto ../protos/ultrasonic_control.proto 
```

## Usage
### API
```
cd ~/Freenove_Three-wheeled_Smart_Car_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi/api
python3 api.py --port 50051
```

### Client
```
cd ~/Freenove_Three-wheeled_Smart_Car_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi/client
conda activate smart-car-client
python client.py --address raspberrypi --port 50051 --car-key <your unique car key displayed by the API upon startup>
```
